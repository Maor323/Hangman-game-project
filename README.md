# Hangman-game-project

In the Hangman game you need to find out the chosen word from a txt file. If you wouldn't succeed to find the chosen word -you will be exposed to the unhappy hangman :( .

To start the game you will need a txt file and it's path. you will need to enter the file path into the game to start.
After enter the path you will need to enter a number, the number is the index location of the chosen word from the txt file.

*I attached here a simple txt file for example. you can make/choose your own file for the game. 

The rules are simple:
- enter file path.
- enter a random number.
- every turn you need to guess a letter.
- you can't guess a letter that you already guessed.
- you can't enter a numeric value or words.
- after every round if you correct you will see hidden word with the guessed letter unhidden.
- if you fail with your guess, after every round a tree will be build.   
- you have 6 tries to fail.
- in the end of the game you will see the chosen word.
